# neuralnetworks
A collection of Neural Networks

Written in Java, there are currently two types of neural networks:

1. Simple Feed Forward Neural Network
2. Radial Basis Function Neural Network

The training algorithm for the latter network is not yet finished (due to complications) - it will be updated soon.

Enjoy!
